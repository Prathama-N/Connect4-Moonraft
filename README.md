## Title - Reinforcement Learning for Connect 4 in a Line Game Bot Training

Developing an intelligent game-playing bot for the Connect 4 in a Line game using Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a challenging task. The objective is to design and train an RL agent capable of making optimal moves in Connect 4, a classic two-player board game. The bot should learn to play strategically, making decisions to win or prevent the opponent from winning, ultimately achieving a high level of gameplay proficiency.
